# Movie_Rating_Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts movie ratings based on various features such as actors, directors, genres, and movie synopsis. It involves preprocessing movie datasets, feature engineering, and training a machine learning model to make accurate predictions.

## 🚀 Features
- **Preprocessing & Analysis**: Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on movie datasets.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting useful insights from user and movie data.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses **Linear Regression** and **XGBoost** for predictions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance measured using **RMSE** and other metrics.
- **Web Deployment**: A **Streamlit** app for real-time rating predictions.

## 📊 Topics Covered
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on movie datasets.
- Feature engineering techniques.
- Training machine learning models using **Scikit-learn**.
- Deploying a **Streamlit** web app for interactive predictions.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **XGBoost**
- **Pickle** (for model serialization)
- **Streamlit** (for web application)

## 🛠 Installation & Usage
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Daniikur/Movie_Rating_Prediction.git
 cd Movie_Rating_Prediction
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Streamlit App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📌 How It Works
1. **Train the Model**
   - Loads the dataset and applies feature engineering.
   - Trains a machine learning model using **Linear Regression** and **XGBoost**.
   - Saves the trained model using **Pickle**.
2. **Make Predictions**
   - Users input actors, directors, genres, and synopsis in the **Streamlit** web app.
   - The model processes the input and predicts the movie rating in real time.

## 🎯 Demo
🚀 Open the Streamlit app and enter movie details to predict ratings instantly!
